Welcome to the manual for the complex calculator

To run the calculator double click Calculator.exe

Key

p = pi
e = exponential
* = multiply
/ = divide
- = minus
+ = plus 


All expressions must follow these rules to get the correct answer

When using brackets

1. There must be at least 2 parameters with an operation inside the brackets e.g (2+5), (5^2), etc. examples that wouldnt work (50), (5-), etc.
2. If an operation is required then put it in, e.g. 2*(5+2), 2/(5+2), etc. Examples that wouldn't work 2(5+2), (2+5)(7-2), etc.

The calcualtor does not take negative numbers such as -1+3, 5--5, etc.
When using e or p you will need to put the * operator in to get the correct answer, e.g. 2*p, 5.4*p, 3*e, etc.
When doing anything you must use 2 parameters otherwise the result will be incorrect or receive an error message in the console e.g 5^, -2, +5, etc will return errors.


Examples of expressions that work

(2*2)
2+2
2*(3*(3^2))
(2*(3-1)*(5^2)/(3^2))/100
2*e
2*p
